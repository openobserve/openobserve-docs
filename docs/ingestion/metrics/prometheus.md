# Prometheus 

You can ingest metrics using prometheus [remote write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) in OpenObserve.

You will then be able to explore the metrics in metrics explorer and build dashboards by querying using SQL. PromQL support for querying metrics is under development.

You could use below configuration for collecting metrics

```yaml
url: https://api.openobserve.ai/api/org_name/prometheus/api/v1/write
queue_config:
  max_samples_per_send: 10000
basic_auth:
  username: root@example.com
  password: password
```

Replace api.openobserve.ai with your self hosted OpenObserve instance if you are hosting it yourself.
