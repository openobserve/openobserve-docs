# MySQL Integration with OpenObserve

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to collect and monitor MySQL database metrics using OpenTelemetry Collector and forward them to OpenObserve.

## Overview

MySQL is one of the most widely used open-source relational databases, powering applications from startups to large-scale enterprises. Monitoring MySQL is critical for ensuring availability, performance, and query efficiency.  

With the **OpenTelemetry Collector** and **OpenObserve**, you can seamlessly ingest MySQL metrics, visualize database health, and set up proactive alerts.

## Steps to Integrate

??? "Prerequisites"
    - Running **MySQL instance(s)**  
    - OpenObserve account ([Cloud](https://cloud.openobserve.ai/web/) or [Self-Hosted](../../../quickstart/#self-hosted-installation))  

??? "Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib"

    Download and install the latest release of `otelcol-contrib`:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fOL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.115.1/otelcol-contrib_0.115.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -xvf otelcol-contrib_0.115.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    sudo mv otelcol-contrib /usr/local/bin/
    otelcol-contrib --version
    ```

    > Replace `v0.115.1` with the latest version for your OS/architecture.

??? "Step 2: Configure the Collector"

    Create a file named `config.yaml` with the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    receivers:
      mysql:
        endpoint: "localhost:3306"
        username: otel
        password: ${env:MYSQL_PASSWORD}

    processors:
      batch:
        send_batch_size: 10000
        send_batch_max_size: 11000
        timeout: 10s

    exporters:
      otlphttp/openobserve:
        endpoint: https://<your-openobserve-endpoint>/api/default
        headers:
          Authorization: Basic <your_auth_token>
          stream-name: default

    service:
      pipelines:
        metrics:
          receivers: [mysql]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlphttp/openobserve]
    ```

    Replace `<your-openobserve-endpoint>` and `<your_auth_token>` with your OpenObserve details.

??? "Step 3: Run the Collector"

    Start the Collector with your configuration:

    ```bash
    otelcol-contrib --config /path/to/config.yaml
    ```

??? "Step 4: Visualize in OpenObserve"

    1. Open **OpenObserve â†’ Streams** and select your metrics stream.

??? "Troubleshooting"

    If you encounter connection issues during setup, consider the following:

    - **Check MySQL Configuration**: Ensure that the MySQL instance is running and the configured user has the necessary privileges to read metrics.  
    - **Firewall and Network Settings**: Verify that your network allows traffic on the MySQL port (default: `3306`).  
    - **Authentication Issues**: Confirm that the username and password configured in the OpenTelemetry Collector match your MySQL credentials.  
    - **Endpoint Validation**: If running MySQL on a remote server, make sure you are using the correct hostname/IP in the `endpoint` field of your collector configuration.  
    - **Collector Logs**: Inspect the OpenTelemetry Collector logs for detailed error messages (`journalctl -u otel-collector -f` on Linux). These logs often indicate whether the issue is authentication, connectivity, or configuration related.
