# Telemetry

## Why do you collect telemetry data?
We collects anonymized data from users in order to understand OpenObserve's usage and improve OpenObserve. This can be deactivated at any time, and any data that has already been collected can be deleted on request. Please send an email to admin+privacy@zinclabs.io to request deletion of the anonymized data. 

## What tools do OpenObserve uses to collect and visualize data?
We use Segment, a platform for data collection and management, to collect usage data. We then feed that data into Amplitude, a tool for graphing and highlighting data, so that we can build visualizations according to our needs.
