  Delete OpenObserve streams via API. Deletion is async and handled by the
  compactor. Configure auto-deletion with data retention environment settings.
---
## Delete stream
OpenObserve provides multiple deletion strategies to manage your data lifecycle: immediate complete stream deletion, targeted time-range deletion with job tracking, and automatic retention-based cleanup.

## Overview
The Delete Stream API allows you to:

- Delete an entire stream and all its data
- Delete data within a specific time period with job tracking
- Monitor deletion job progress across clusters
- Manage cached query results
All deletion operations are asynchronous and processed by the Compactor service.

## Base URL
`https://example.remote.dev/`
Replace `example.remote.dev` with your actual OpenObserve instance URL.

## Content type
All requests and responses use JSON format.
```
Content-Type: application/json
```
## Endpoints

### Delete entire stream
Delete a complete stream and all associated data.

#### Request
**Method**: `DELETE` <br>
**Path**: `/api/{org_id}/streams/{stream_name}?type=logs&delete_all=true` <br>
**Parameters**:
| Name | Type | Location | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| org_id | string | path | Yes | Organization identifier |
| stream_name | string | path | Yes | Name of the stream to delete |
| type | string | query | Yes | Stream type: `logs`, `metrics`, or `traces` |
| delete_all | boolean | path | Yes | Delete all related resources like alerts and dashboards |

#### Request example
```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'https://example.remote.dev/api/default/streams/pii_test?type=logs&delete_all=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

#### Response
**Status Code:** `200 OK`
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "stream deleted"
}
```

#### Response fields
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| code | integer | HTTP status code |
| message | string | Confirmation message |

#### Status codes
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 | Stream deleted successfully |
| 400 | Invalid parameters |
| 404 | Stream not found |
| 500 | Internal server error |

#### Behavior
Deletion is asynchronous and does not happen immediately:

1. When you call this API, the deletion request is marked in the system.
2. The API responds immediately, you do not wait for actual deletion.
3. A background service called Compactor checks for pending deletions every 10 minutes.
4. When Compactor runs, it starts deleting your stream. This can take anywhere from seconds to several minutes depending on how much data the stream contains.
5. In the worst-case scenario (if you request deletion just before Compactor runs), the entire process could take up to 30 minutes total.
6. You do not need to wait. The deletion happens in the background. You can check the stream status later to confirm it has been deleted.

!!! note "Notes"

	- This operation cannot be undone.
	- Data is deleted from both the `file_list` table and object store.
	- No job tracking is available for this endpoint

!!! note "Environment variables"
	- You can change the `compactor` run interval: `ZO_COMPACT_INTERVAL=600`. Unit is second. default is `10 minutes`.
	- You can configure data life cycle to auto delete old data: `ZO_COMPACT_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=30`. The system will auto delete the data after `30` days. Note that the value must be greater than `0`.

### Delete stream data by time range
Delete stream data within a specific time period with job tracking.
