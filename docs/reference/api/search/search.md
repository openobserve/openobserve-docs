## Agent options

### `output_format`

Controls how hits are formatted in the response. Useful for agent/MCP clients that pay per token.

| Value       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `json`      | Default. Hits returned as a JSON array of objects. |
| `csv`       | Tabular hits as a compact CSV block (~40% fewer tokens than JSON). |
| `md_table`  | Tabular hits as a Markdown table. Best for small result sets. |

### `mode: partition`

Set `agent_options.mode` to `partition` to run search through the streaming backend pipeline. The server scans time partitions one by one and stops early once enough rows are collected, which reduces data scanned for top-N queries. For aggregation queries, the server accumulates reusable cache partition by partition, so repeated queries against shifting time windows hit progressively warmer cache instead of invalidating a monolithic entry.

This mode is designed for agent/MCP clients that speak plain request-response and cannot consume SSE — it exposes the same partitioned execution that the streaming `_search_stream` endpoint uses, collected into a single response.

| Value       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `default`   | (default) Single search through the result cache path. Behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged. |
| `partition` | Partitioned execution with per-partition early termination and streaming-agg caching, collected into one response. |

**Key behaviors in partition mode:**

- **Early termination**: scanning stops once the query has enough rows; useful for `SELECT ... LIMIT 100`-style queries scanning a wide time range.
- **Progressive aggregation cache**: aggregation queries (histogram, term counts, etc.) build up the streaming-agg cache partition by partition, so follow-up queries with similar time windows reuse cached work.
- **Cancellation**: if the HTTP client disconnects (drops the request), the per-partition loop stops — you are not billed for scanning partitions you never see.
- **No SSE required**: the response is a plain JSON `Response` identical in shape to `default` mode, with all hit pages and scan counters folded together.

**When to use partition mode:**

- Your client cannot consume SSE (MCP tools, REST clients, curl-based scripts).
- You are scanning a large time range but only need a few rows (top-N or sample).
- You run exploratory queries that shift their time window with each call — the progressive cache rewards this pattern.
- **Do NOT** split the time range yourself and call `_search` in a loop. Let the server do it with one call in `partition` mode.

## SQL Syntax

Please refer to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax.html) for SQL Syntax.

Notes:

- We have a build-in time field, `_timestamp` you can use it to do time range filter.
- Field name can not start with `@`.
- Field name can use double quote or without quote.
- Field integer value without quote.
- Field string value must use single quote.

## Limitation

- You should give a time range for each query or it will scan all data, it is a very expensive operate.


## Examples

Here list some common examples, if you want more example please create a issue tell us, we will add it.

### Query latest 10 record logs

```json
{
    "query": {
        "sql": "SELECT * FROM {stream}",
        "start_time": 1674789786006000,
        "end_time": 1674789786006000,
        "from": 0,
        "size": 10
    }
}
```

### Query latest 10 record logs with filter

```json
{
    "query": {
        "sql": "SELECT * FROM {stream} WHERE kubernetes.namespace_name='default' AND code=200 ",
        "start_time": 1674789786006000,
        "end_time": 1674789786006000,
        "from": 0,
        "size": 10
    }
}
```

### Full text query

```json
{
    "query": {
        "sql": "SELECT * FROM {stream} WHERE match_all('err') ",
        "start_time": 1674789786006000,
        "end_time": 1674789786006000,
        "from": 0,
        "size": 10
    }
}
```

### Match on a field (log)

```json
{
    "query": {
        "sql": "SELECT * FROM {stream} WHERE str_match(log, 'err') ",
        "start_time": 1674789786006000,
        "end_time": 1674789786006000,
        "from": 0,
        "size": 10
    }
}
```

### Histogram aggregation (full mode)

```json
{
    "query": {
       "sql": "SELECT histogram(_timestamp, '5 minute') AS key, COUNT(*) AS num FROM {stream} GROUP BY key ORDER BY key LIMIT 10 OFFSET 1",
        "start_time": 1674789786006000,
        "end_time": 1674789786006000
    }
}
```

### Term aggregation (full mode)

```json
{
    "query": {
       "sql": "SELECT kubernetes.namespace_name AS namespace, COUNT(*) AS num FROM {stream} GROUP BY namespace ORDER BY namespace",
        "start_time": 1674789786006000,
        "end_time": 1674789786006000
    }
}
```

### Use custom functions 

```json
{
    "query": {
       "sql": "SELECT *, my_func(log) as mykey FROM {stream}",
        "start_time": 1674789786006000,
        "end_time": 1674789786006000,
        "from": 0,
        "size": 10
    }
}
```

### Partition mode with CSV output

Run a top-N query across a wide time window with partition mode, returning hits as compact CSV:

```json
{
    "query": {
        "sql": "SELECT * FROM {stream} WHERE code=500 ORDER BY _timestamp DESC",
        "start_time": 1674000000000000,
        "end_time": 1675000000000000,
        "from": 0,
        "size": 50
    },
    "agent_options": {
        "mode": "partition",
        "output_format": "csv"
    }
}
```

With `mode: partition`, the server scans partitions one by one and stops early once it has 50 rows, instead of scanning the full time range through the cache path.

### Partition mode for aggregation

```json
{
    "query": {
        "sql": "SELECT kubernetes_namespace_name, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM {stream} GROUP BY kubernetes_namespace_name ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 10",
        "start_time": 1674000000000000,
        "end_time": 1675000000000000
    },
    "agent_options": {
        "mode": "partition"
    }
}
```

Each partition's aggregation result accumulates into a progressively merged cache entry. Follow-up queries with slightly shifted time windows reuse that cached work.

## Next steps

- [Example queries](../../../user-guide/data-exploration/example-queries.md): copy-paste SQL examples to try.
- [Full-text search functions](../../sql-functions/full-text-search.md): `match_all`, `str_match`, `re_match`, and friends.
- [Logs UI](../../../user-guide/data-exploration/logs/logs.md): run these queries interactively.
