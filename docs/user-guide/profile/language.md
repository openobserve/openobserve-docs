  Switch UI language in OpenObserve via your profile. Choose from 11 languages.
  Only UI elements are translated—your data stays unchanged.

OpenObserve supports multiple UI languages. You can switch the interface language to your preference in just a few clicks. 

**Key Points**

- OpenObserve’s UI language is user-specific. Any user accessing the instance can set their own preferred language from the profile menu, regardless of the language in which the instance was originally created.  
- Changing the language does not affect logs, metrics, traces, or queries.
