OpenObserve supports multiple UI languages. You can switch the interface language to your preference in just a few clicks. 

**Key Points**

- OpenObserve’s UI language is user-specific. Any user accessing the instance can set their own preferred language from the profile menu, regardless of the language in which the instance was originally created.  
- Changing the language does not affect logs, metrics, traces, or queries.
