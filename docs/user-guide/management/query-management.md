The **Query Management** page provides **real-time visibility and control** over all currently running queries across dashboards, alerts, logs, and reports within an OpenObserve instance. Using the **Query Management page**, you can decide whether to cancel a query or leave it running. 

## Availability

The Query Management feature is available only in high-availability (HA) deployments.

## Access

By default, `root` users and any predefined user roles (`Admin`,`Editor`,`Viewer`, or `User`) with access to the `_meta` organization can access the **Query Management** page. RBAC cannot grant access to other custom roles. 

**To access the Query Management page:**

1. Select `_meta` organization from the top right corner.   
2. Go to **Management**. 
3. In the side panel, select **Query Management**.   
   You will be taken to the **Running Queries** section.

## Viewing Modes

You can toggle between:

- **User Summary**: Groups all queries by user and displays their combined activity.  
- **All Queries**: Displays each query individually with full details and filtering options.

Use **User Summary** for high-level monitoring. Switch to **All Queries** when you need to investigate specific query behavior.

## Page Layout and Field Descriptions

The **Running Queries** table displays the following fields:

- **Email**: The email ID of the user who initiated the queries.

You will see a pop-up with full information about the query:

- Current status (e.g., waiting, processing).  
- User email and organization ID.  
- Stream type (e.g., logs).  
- The complete SQL query.  
- The start time and end time selected by the user. This defines the **Query Range**.  
- The **Execution Duration** and final **Query Range** calculated.  
- Additional technical metrics, including the number of records scanned within the selected time range, the original size of the scanned files, and their compressed size in Parquet format.

**To cancel from All Queries**:

1. Find the query you want to cancel.  
2. In the **Actions** column, click the red `X` icon.

After you confirm, the query is terminated immediately.

## When Should You Cancel a Query

You should cancel a query if any of the following are true:

- The execution time has exceeded acceptable limits.  
- The time range being queried is too wide.   
- The system is under strain, and this query appears in a long or waiting state.

Avoid canceling if:

- The query is from a critical source. 

> **Note:** Canceling a query may interrupt active investigations. Confirm the impact before proceeding.
