# Functions Overview

In OpenObserve, functions are VRL (Vector Remap Language) scripts that transform your stream data. You create and manage functions via the OpenObserve UI or API. In the UI, go to **Pipelines > Functions** to open a built-in editor where you can write, test, and save VRL code. Once saved, a function can be associated with a stream so it runs on incoming data at ingest time.
