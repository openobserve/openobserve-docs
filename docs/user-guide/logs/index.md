## What are Logs
Logs are a type of stream in OpenObserve that record structured event data from applications, systems, or services. Each log entry includes a timestamp, message, and optional metadata fields such as severity, service name, or container details.

You can use the Logs page to:

- View and filter log data by time and fields
- Write and run SQL queries
- Transform logs using VRL functions
- Save views and schedule recurring searches
- Export logs for offline analysis

## Access

- **Enterprise** and **Cloud** editions support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict log access per stream and role.
- **Open Source** edition provides full access to all logs for all users.
