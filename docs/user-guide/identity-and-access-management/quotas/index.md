Quotas in OpenObserve are rate limiting mechanisms that let you control how many API requests users can make per second. You can use Quotas to define request-per-second (Req/s) limits for API operations such as **List**, **Get**, **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete**. 
These limits can be applied in two ways, at org-level and at role-level.
