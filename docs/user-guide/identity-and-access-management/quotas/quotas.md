  Control API usage in OpenObserve with quotas. Set rate limits per org or role,
  manage access via RBAC, and prevent overload with smart rate limiting.

This guide explains what Quotas are, how to configure them, how to navigate the Quotas interface, and how to set quota limits.

## What Are Quotas

Quotas in OpenObserve are rate limiting mechanisms that let you control how many API requests users can make per second. 

You can use Quotas to define request-per-second (Req/s) limits for API operations such as **List**, **Get**, **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete**. 
These limits can be applied in two ways: 

- At org-level: Limit how many requests all users in an organization can make to a specific API, such as Logs or Alerts.
- At role-level: Limit how many requests all users in a specific role can make to an API.

> **Note**: If a user exceeds the defined quota, OpenObserve returns a `RateLimitExceeded` error.

### Availability
The Quotas feature is available only in high-availability (HA) deployments.

### Access
By default, only root users can access the Quotas settings from the `_meta` organization. You can grant access to other roles using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).  

>To grant access to other user roles using RBAC: 
>
>1. Log in as a root user.  
>2. Switch to the `_meta` organization from the top navigation bar.  
>3. From the left navigation menu, go to **IAM**.  
>4. Select the **Roles** tab.  
>5. Click the edit icon next to the role you want to update.  
>6. In the **Permissions** tab:  
>   
>    - Locate the **Rate Limit** section.  
>    - Select the type of access you want to grant (e.g., read, write, etc.).  
>    - Review and confirm that the users assigned to the role are correct.  
>7. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

## How to Configure Quotas Using Environment Variables

### Prerequisites

Before you use the Quotas feature, ensure that the following are true:

- You are using the Enterprise Edition in High-Availability mode. [Refer to the Enterprise Edition Installation Guide.](../../../openobserve-enterprise-edition-installation-guide.md)   
- You have access to **Quotas**.   
- You have switched to the `_meta` organization in the UI.

### Step 1: Enable Quotas

Set `O2_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` to true in the `enterprise.parameters` section of your `values.yaml` file, as shown below. This activates the Quotas feature in OpenObserve.

```bash linenums="1" 
enterprise:  

  enabled: true  

  parameters:

`O2_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` : “true”

```

### Step 2: Set the internal queue store to coordinate rate limiting

Set `ZO_QUEUE_STORE` to “nats”  in the `config` section of the values.yaml file. This enables internal queuing through NATS for coordinating rate limiting. 

```bash linenums="1" 
`config:

`ZO_QUEUE_STORE` : “nats”

```

## Quotas Interface

The Quotas page provides a tabbed interface with two views:

### API Limits

Use this to set **org-level** quotas for a specific API module. The limit applies to **all users in the selected organization**, regardless of their role.

You can also apply rules globally by selecting the **global rules** option under the organization selector dropdown. This applies the limit across all organizations and their respective user roles.

### Role Limits

Use this to set **role-level** quotas for specific API modules within an organization. This allows more granular control by assigning **different limits** to each role for the same API module.

![Quotas Role Limits](../../../images/quotas-role-limits-view.png)

Each tab displays a table with the following:

- **Module**: The API module (e.g., Alerts, Dashboards).  
- **Operations:** Columns for List, Get, Create, Update, and Delete.  
- **Values**: Request-per-second (Req/s) limits per operation.

> **Note:**
>
>- A dash **(–)** means rate limiting is not applicable.   
>- A value of **0** indicates no rate limit is enforced.

## How to Set Quotas

You can configure quotas in two ways:

- By organization using the **API Limits** tab
- By user role using the **Role Limits** tab

### Set API Limits

1. Go to the **API Limits** tab.  
2. Select the target organization from the dropdown.  
3. Click **Edit Quota**.  
4. Enter Req/s limits for each operation against the desired module.   
   Note: You can edit quotas in bulk in both **Table** and **JSON** formats.  
5. Click **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: API limits apply across all roles in the selected organization. <br>
> **Important:** Rate limiting for the Search module requires special consideration. [Learn more](#quota-consideration-for-search-module). 

### Set Role Limits

1. Go to the **Role Limits** tab.  
2. Select the organization and role from the dropdowns.  
3. Expand the role row to view its module list.  
4. Click **Edit Quota**.  
5. Enter limits (Req/s) for each operation.   
   Note: You can edit quotas in bulk in both **Table** and **JSON** formats.  
6. Click **Save Changes**.

>**Note**: Role limits override API limits if both are defined.

## Quota Consideration for Search Module

When you run a search query in OpenObserve, the search query is internally divided into multiple partition-level queries, one for each time-based partition that falls within the selected time range.

This means that a single search from the user can trigger multiple internal search calls, depending on how the data is partitioned.

### What is a Partition

A partition in OpenObserve is a time-based chunk of data. It is automatically determined based on:

- The time range selected for the query  
- The size of the data in that time range

### How to View Partitions for a Selected Time Range 

To check how your search query is internally split into partitions:

1. From the left navigation menu, go to the **Logs** page.  
2. Select the target stream from the stream selector.  
3. In the SQL editor, write a query to fetch data from the selected stream. For example:  
   ```sql linenums="1"   
   SELECT * FROM default  
   ```  
4. Select the desired time range from the time range selector (top-right corner).  
5. Right-click anywhere on the browser and select **Inspect** to open your browser’s developer tools.  
6. Go to the Network tab.  
7. Click **Run Query** in the OpenObserve UI.   
8. Look for a request named: `_search_partition?type=logs`  
9. Click the request and view its **Preview** tab.  
10. In the **Preview** tab, find the **partitions** section, which looks like the following:

``` linenums="1" 

partitions: [

  [timestamp_1_start, timestamp_1_end],

  [timestamp_2_start, timestamp_2_end]

]

```

Each pair of timestamps represents one partition.

> **Example:** 
> If your 15-minute query results in 2 partitions, the system makes 2 internal search calls. If your quota > for the Search module is set to 1 request per second (1 Req/s), only one request can be processed at a > time. The second request is blocked, and you may see:

`Request limit reached for ratelimit/_search`

### Quota Planning for Search Module

There is no standard recommendation for setting the minimum quota for the Search module. The appropriate quota depends on your:

- Average query time range  
- Expected number of partitions  
- Number of concurrent users running queries

To define an effective quota, consider testing the partition behavior for your typical query patterns using the method above.
