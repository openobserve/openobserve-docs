  Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in OpenObserve Enterprise Edition
  using OpenFGA to manage access and enforce permissions across resources.
---
This guide provides instructions for enabling Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in OpenObserve Enterprise Edition. OpenObserve uses OpenFGA to manage RBAC.

#### Before You Begin

- Review the [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Guide](role-based-access-control.md) to understand how RBAC works in OpenObserve.
- Ensure you meet all prerequisites before starting the installation.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling RBAC, ensure the following:

- You must have **OpenObserve Enterprise Edition** installed and running. Refer to the [OpenObserve Enterprise Edition Installation Guide](../../openobserve-enterprise-edition-installation-guide.md).
- You must have **administrator access** to the system where OpenObserve is deployed.

## Step 1: Install OpenFGA

OpenFGA must be installed before using RBAC. It can be installed using:

- [**Helm Chart (Recommended Method)**](#option-1-install-openfga-using-helm-chart)
- [**Alternative Methods**](#option-2-install-openfga-without-helm) (Docker, Docker Compose, Package Manager, Pre-compiled Binaries, or Building from Scratch)

### Option 1: Install OpenFGA Using Helm Chart

Helm Chart is a package manager for Kubernetes, and its configuration is stored in a file called `values.yaml`.

#### Prerequisite

Ensure you have **Kubernetes** and the **OpenObserve Helm Chart** installed.

**To enable RBAC using Helm Chart:** 
<br><br>1. Set `openfga.enabled: true` in `values.yaml` file.<br> 
Navigate to the `values.yaml` file in the OpenObserve Helm chart repository and update this configuration as follows:

```yml linenums="1"
openfga:
    enabled: true
    parameters:
      O2_OPENFGA_LIST_ONLY_PERMITTED: "false"
      O2_MAP_GROUP_TO_ROLE: "true"
      O2_MAP_GROUP_TO_ROLE_SKIP_CREATION: "false"
      O2_OPENFGA_PAGE_SIZE: "100"
    image:
      repository: openfga/openfga
      tag: latest
      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```
2. Run the following commands to update Helm:

```sh
helm repo update
kubectl get namespaces
```

If the output shows **openobserve**, run the `helm upgrade` command:

```sh
helm upgrade --namespace openobserve -f values.yaml o2 openobserve/openobserve
```

If the output does not show **openobserve**, run the `kubectl create` command before executing the `helm upgrade` command: 
    
```sh 
kubectl create ns openobserve
```
```sh
helm upgrade --namespace openobserve -f values.yaml o2 openobserve/openobserve
```
3. After deployment, verify if all the pods are in a running state:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n openobserve
```
**Expected output:** All pods should be in the `Running` state.


### Option 2: Install OpenFGA Without Helm

If you prefer not to use Helm, OpenFGA can be installed and run using other methods:

- [Docker](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/openfga/openfga?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-compose)  
- [Package Manager](https://github.com/openfga/openfga?tab=readme-ov-file#package-managers)
- [Pre-compiled Binaries](https://github.com/openfga/openfga?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-compiled-binaries)
- [Building from Scratch](https://github.com/openfga/openfga?tab=readme-ov-file#building-from-source)

**Impportant Note:** 

When installing OpenFGA using the alternative methods, you must run the OpenFGA and OpenObserve servers separately. Refer to the respective installation links for instructions on running the OpenFGA server. Ensure that you run the `openfga migrate` command before running the `openfga run` command. Check the [Quickstart guide](https://openobserve.ai/docs/quickstart/#openobserve-cloud) for steps to run the OpenObserve server.
<br>If you are installing OpenFGA with Helm charts, deploying the Helm chart is sufficient.

## Step 2: Configure OpenFGA Environment Variables

After the OpenFGA server is up and running, update the following environment variables:

**Note:** If you enabled OpenFGA using Kubernetes with OpenObserve Helm charts, you do not need to set the `O2_OPENFGA_ENABLED` and `O2_OPENFGA_BASE_URL` environment variables manually. Setting OpenFGA in the `values.yaml` file is sufficient.


#### **Required Environment Variables**
| **Environment Variable** | **Default Value** | **Description** |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `O2_OPENFGA_ENABLED` | `false` | Determines whether OpenFGA is enabled. <br>Set this value to `true` to enable OpenFGA. |
| `O2_OPENFGA_BASE_URL` | N/A | Enter the URL of the OpenFGA server. <br> **Example:** If the OpenFGA server is running locally on port `8080`, set this to: <br> `http://localhost:8080` |


#### **Optional Environment Variables**
| **Environment Variable** | **Default Value** | **Description** |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `O2_OPENFGA_STORE_NAME` | `openobserve` | Specifies the name of the OpenFGA store. Default value is sufficient. |
| `O2_OPENFGA_PAGE_SIZE` | `100` | Defines the number of records inserted into the OpenFGA database at a time. |
| `O2_OPENFGA_LIST_ONLY_PERMITTED` | `false` | If `O2_OPENFGA_LIST_ONLY_PERMITTED` is set to `true`, assigning only the `List` permission to a resource (such as **Alerts**) will not allow users to see its contents. <br> **Example:** If a user has the `List` permission for alerts, the **Alerts** page will appear empty, but no error will be shown. To allow users to see alerts, you must also assign them the `Get` permission. |
